# AutoSuggest

Mirror of the AutoSuggest library by Timothy Groves - http://www.brandspankingnew.net

## Synopsis

This script was a popular JavaScript library, which development had
been ended 2007.

Nevertheless, it still gets used nowadays in some legacy applications.

The site, where the source code and the documentation was hosted, is
no longer online accessible.

You can still access it via archive.org:
https://web.archive.org/web/20160306051630/http://brandspankingnew.net/archive/2007/02/ajax_auto_suggest_v2.html

For convenience, and to prevent the loss of the source code, I created
this GitHub mirror.

## Plans

There are neither plans to update this script, nor to accept issues
and pull requests.

So if you need some modification, please fork it.
